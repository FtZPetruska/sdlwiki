= SDL_FillRects =

Perform a fast fill of a set of rectangles with a specific color.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_FillRects
    (SDL_Surface * dst, const SDL_Rect * rects, int count, Uint32 color);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''dst'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is the drawing target
|-
|'''rects'''
|an array of [[SDL_Rect]] representing the rectangles to fill.
|-
|'''count'''
|the number of rectangles in the array
|-
|'''color'''
|the color to fill with
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

<code>color</code> should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and
can be generated by [[SDL_MapRGB]]() or [[SDL_MapRGBA]](). If the color
value contains an alpha component then the destination is simply filled
with that alpha information, no blending takes place.

If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via
[[SDL_SetClipRect]]()), then this function will fill based on the
intersection of the clip rectangle and <code>rect</code>.
