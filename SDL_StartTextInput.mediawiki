== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_StartTextInput(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This function will start accepting Unicode text input events in the focused
SDL window, and start emitting [[SDL_TextInputEvent]] ([[SDL_TEXTINPUT]])
and [[SDL_TextEditingEvent]] ([[SDL_TEXTEDITING]]) events. Please use this
function in pair with [[SDL_StopTextInput]]().

On some platforms using this function activates the screen keyboard.

On desktop platforms, [[SDL_StartTextInput]]() is implicitly called on SDL window creation which will cause events [[SDL_TextInputEvent]] and [[SDL_TextEditingEvent]] to begin emitting.
