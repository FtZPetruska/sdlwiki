= SDL_GetTicks64 =

Get the number of milliseconds since SDL library initialization.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
Uint64 SDL_GetTicks64(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns an unsigned 64-bit value representing the number of milliseconds
since the SDL library initialized.

== Remarks ==

Note that you should not use the [[SDL_TICKS_PASSED]] macro with values
returned by this function, as that macro does clever math to compensate for
the 32-bit overflow every ~49 days that [[SDL_GetTicks]]() suffers from.
64-bit values from this function can be safely compared directly.

For example, if you want to wait 100 ms, you could do this:

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
const Uint64 timeout = SDL_GetTicks64() + 100;
while (SDL_GetTicks64() < timeout) {
    // ... do work until timeout has elapsed
}
</syntaxhighlight>

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.18.
